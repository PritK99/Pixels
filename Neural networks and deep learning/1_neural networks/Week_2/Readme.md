# Neural networks and deep learning

## Week 2

### Understanding
Week 2 covers several topics such as linear regression, binary classification, logistic regression, loss function, cost function, gradient descent etc.
Further, Week 2 teaches us vectorization and explains the use of numpy. Also we learn why we should prefer the use of numpy and vectorization over using explicit loops or using math libraries.

### Notes

The entire theory and working of code is explained in the Logiestic_Regression_with_a_neural_network assignment
