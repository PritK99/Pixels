This lecture introduces us to the ways images are represented in computer, the way they are aquired from the sensors,

## Notes 

The camera that we use, is made of many sensors. The problem with these sensor here is that it is very good at detecting the <b> intensity of light </b> and NOT the colour of light. Thus, each photosite is colorblind. It only keeps track of the total intensity of the light that strikes its surface. 

This is what we need for grayscale, just the intensity of light at each point. But for RGB, we need sense of colour.

In order to get a full color image, most sensors use filtering to look at the light in its three primary colors.
