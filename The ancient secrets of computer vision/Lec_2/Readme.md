## Notes 

High level vision is not only limited to extracting semantics out of an image, but also deals with creating an image out of the semantics.
for eg. given a vector, computer can form randomly generated images from it which it has never seen before.

This lecture introduces us to how eyes work and how human eye process light and images.

<p>The eyes have evolved over time from just being able to detect the presence of light in some organisms to able to detect the direction of light precisely for other organisms. This goes from simple protiens called eyespots to pinhole eyes to eyes with lenses.</p>

<p>Then we start to understand human eye which is majorly comprised of rods and cones. Our eyes have more number of rods than cones. Further, the cones are concentrated at one spot majorly. The blind spot is spot where there are no rods or cones. This leads to several interesting phenomena regarding peripheral vision, night vision etc.</p>

We also learn about ventral and dorsal system, where ventral system is used for recognition and identification of objects, while the dorsal system guides you to do stuff like picking up objects.

Light essentially, is an electromagnetic wave. The colour of any object depend on the illumination of source and reflectance of object. eg. In daylight, an apple appears to be red because of the light sun is emmiting and reflectance of apple. The same apple colour might apprear different under LED cause the light it is emmiting is different from the light emitted by sun.

This is also the reason why makeup might look different when applied in house under LEDs and under sunlight. This is because the illumination factor is different in both the cases.

Our perception of colour comes from the cones. Cones generally need sufficient light to get activated, unlike rods. Thus at night we dont clearly see colours cause our cones are less active than the rods. Thus rods which work in dim light as well are resplonsible for night vision. Thus, the colours which we see are due to the 3 different kinds of cones. Colour blind is a condition which happens when one lacks a certain type of cone out of these 3 types. These cones are also called as red, blue, green cones. All the colours that we percive are a certain combination of this red, gree, and blue light.
